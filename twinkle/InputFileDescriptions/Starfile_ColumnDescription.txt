These are the column headers that need to be included in the input file under "files">"stinfo_file" in the 
input JSON file. The column strings should not have the asterisks. If the "*" 'd columns are not included, 
then the **'d columns in the "optional" are required. If the *** columns are included, then "changekeys" 
in the JSON file must be set to "true" for these columns to be used.


All the columns [band]m, [band]me, [band]_flux, [band]_fluxe are the formats to use to include spectral data.
If the data is photometric, use [band]m, and [band]me, and the other two for fluxes in Jy. 

The band options are listed below in the "available_filters.txt" file

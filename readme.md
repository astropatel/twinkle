## Introduction

**Twinkle** is a Python-based tool that calculates the spectral energy distribution ([SED](https://coolwiki.ipac.caltech.edu/index.php/SED_plots_introduction)) of a stellar source using empirical photometric data and stellar model grids.

*Twinkle* was originally created to help calculate the excess infrared (IR) flux from a star. The presence of an IR excess indicates dust orbiting the star. This dust likely results from the grinding and collisions of asteroids, influenced by a larger planetary objectâ€”pointing to the potential for finding planets. You can check out the published papers from my thesis using this code in [Patel, Metchev, and Heinze, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/212/1/10) and [Patel et al., 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/153/2/54).

This code base helps you quickly calculate the temperature and location of the dust to first order by fitting the assumed blackbody or modified blackbody function to the broadband excess emission.

## Available Features

- Model multiple stellar SEDs at once with an easy-to-use stellar input file.
- Late B to K-spectral type modeling support. Additional spectral type modeling is possible but not tested (*yet*).
- Plotting capabilities (link to plotting page upcoming) of the empirical data and the modeled distribution.
- This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/astropatel/twinkle/blob/master/Twinkle_Tutorial.ipynb) provides a quick-start guide to using **Twinkle**.

> **Note:**  
> The code hasn't been tested in a while, so there may be issues still being worked on. If you want to contribute, fork and submit a pull request.
